				<h3>
					General information on the legal basis for data processing on this
					website
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal
					data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) a DSGVO or Art. 9 (2) a DSGVO, if
					special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1)
					DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal
					data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49
					(1) a DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the

					If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to
					these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out
					that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be
					guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged
					to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a
					data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can
					therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. intelligence
					services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on
					US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these
					processing activities.
				</p>
				<h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
				<p>

					consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time.

					remains unaffected by the revocation.

					PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE
					PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED
					CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER
					PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE
					COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR
					INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE
					OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER
					ARTICLE 21(1) DSGVO).
				</p>
				<p>
					IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT
					MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING
					OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING;

					State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of
					the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other
					administrative or judicial remedies.

					basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
					you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
					request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this
					will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
				</p>

				<p>
					Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
					right at any time to free information about your stored personal data,
					its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if
					necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this
					purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal
					data, you can contact us at any time.
				</p>
				<h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
				<p>
					You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
					your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time.
					The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
						usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review,
						you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
						your personal data.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
						unlawfully, you may request the restriction of data processing
						instead of erasure.

						data.

					reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a
					Member State.
